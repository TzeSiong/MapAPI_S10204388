# MapAPI
This project is about allowing a efficient use for finding an area where the person wants to check out. It uses a map API which would allow it to help locate the area of interests close to the user's preferences. Additionally, it calculates the driving distance for the user to see

# Design Process
The design of the website is planned to be simplistic and easy to use for users. The colour scheme is kept to use cool colours like green, turquoise and blue. Each page would have a simple interface and allow users to be comfortable using the site and not overwhelmed with information.
